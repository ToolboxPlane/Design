\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter shall capture all requirements posed to the
system by this task and refine them to use as a basis for
both implementation and verification.

The refinement consists of multiple levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The operational requirements (OP) capture all requirements directly necessary for airplane operation.
        The verification of the OP requirements is done during mission execution.
    \item The plane high-level (P-HL) requirements decompose the operational requirements into testable requirements
        and extend them by design-decision relevant to the implementation of the complete plane.
        The verification of the P-HL requirements is done using flight tests.
    \item The plane low-level (P-LL) requirements further decompose the plane high-level requirements and allocate them to
        specific systems.
        The verification of the P-LL requirements is done via the verification of the system specific HL requirements.
    \item The system-specific high-level requirements consist of the plane low-level requirements allocated to this system
        and system-specific design decisions.
        The verification of the system-specific high-level requirements is done via integration tests of the system.
    \item The system-specific low-level requirements refine the system-specific high-level requirements 
        for implementation. 
        The verification of the implementation requirements is done using unit tests.
\end{itemize}

An exemplary overview of the structure is given in Figure \ref{fig:reqStructure}.

Requirements are formulated using the wording defined in \cite{rfc2119}, with keywords in all UPPERCASE.
