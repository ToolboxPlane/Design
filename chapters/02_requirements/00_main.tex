\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter shall capture all requirements posed to the
system by this task and refine them to use as a basis for
both implementation and verification.
The refinement consists of multiple levels:
firstly the product requirements capture the which are directly
derived from the task. The System High-Level requirements
decompose the individual requirements into verifiable
requirements. The System Low-Level requirements refine the 
High-Level requirements to allocate them exclusively to one
component. The System Low-Level requirements for a component
are then used to capture the High-Level requirements for the respective
component. The complete requirements hierarchy is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:reqStructure}.
