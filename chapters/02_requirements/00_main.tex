\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter shall capture all requirements posed to the
system by this task and refine them to use as a basis for
both implementation and verification.

The refinement consists of multiple levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The operational requirements (OP) capture all requirements directly necessary for airplane operation.
    \item The plane high-level (P-HL) requirements decompose the operational requirements into testable requirements
        and extend them by design-decision relevant to the implementation of the complete plane.
    \item The plane low-level (P-LL) requirements further decompose the plane high-level requirements and allocate them to
        specific systems.
    \item The system-specific high-level requirements consist of the plane low-level requirements allocated to this system
        and system-specific design decisions.
    \item The system-specific low-level requirements refine the high-level requirements and allocate them to specific
        sub-systems/modules.
    \item The sub-system-specific implementation requirements refine the system-specific low-level requirements and
        use them as a basis for implementation and unit testing.
\end{itemize}
The complete requirements hierarchy is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:reqStructure}.
