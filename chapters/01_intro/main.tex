\chapter{Introduction}
This is the requirements and design document for
Toolbox Plane, an automated model plane. It is designed
to fly autonomously for up to 100km with an automated launch
and landing.

This document is structured into three chapters: the first
chapter captures the requirements and refines them to be
used as a basis for implementation and verification.
The second chapter assesses the safety risk posed by failures
of the different components and describes mitigations
to limit the risk. The last chapter describes the exact
interfaces and protocols used between the different
components.
