\chapter{Safety Assesment}
The following chapter lists the possible failure conditions
of the different components, their severity and derived
mitigations. The severity of an issue is classified in 
five levels, depending on the influence of the performance
of the complete system, Table \ref{tab:03:severityLevels}
list these levels.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule 
        Level & Consequence of Failure \\
        \midrule
        A & Failure will lead to loss of aircraft \\
        B & Failure will lead to damage of aircraft \\
        C & Failure will result in non-fulfillment of mission \\ 
        D & Failure will lead to inconvenience during mission fulfillment \\
        E & No consequence on aircraft \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Safety Levels}
    \label{tab:03:severityLevels}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:03:failure} lists all possible failures
and the mitigations undertaken to reduce the risk posed
by the failure. The extent and necessity of the mitigation
is determined by the severity of the failure condition.
