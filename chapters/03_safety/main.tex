\chapter{Safety Assesment}
The following chapter lists the possible failure conditions
and their severity. The severity of an issue is classified in 
five levels, depending on the influence of the performance
of the complete system, Table \ref{tab:03:severityLevels}
list these levels.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule 
        Level & Consequence of Failure \\
        \midrule
        A & Failure will lead to loss of aircraft \\
        B & Failure will lead to damage of aircraft \\
        C & Failure will result in non-fulfillment of mission \\ 
        D & Failure will lead to inconvenience during mission fulfillment \\
        E & No consequence on aircraft \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Safety Levels}
    \label{tab:03:severityLevels}
\end{table}

\section{Failure Analysis}

Table \ref{tab:03:failure} lists all analyzed failures,
the failures are determined by analyzing all external interactions
of the systems under the aspects of availability and integrity of 
the interaction.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|p{6cm}}
        \toprule
        Failure & Severity & \\
        \midrule
        Loss of control surface actuation & A & Without control surface actuation no stable flight can be guaranteed \\
        Invalid control surface actuation & A & With incorrect control surface actuation no stable flight can be guaranteed \\
        Loss of thrust & B & Without thrust an emergency landing must be performed \\
        Invalid thurst control & C & \\
        Loss of debug data & D & \\
        Invalid debug data & C & \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Failure Conditions}
    \label{tab:03:failure}
\end{table}

\section{Fault Analysis}
For the failures listed above, all faults by components will result in the 
respective failure shall be analyzed and mitigations to avoid the fault 
shall be found. 
The extent and necessity of the mitigations are determined by the severity of the failure.
