\dd
    {1}{Take-Off}
    {
        The airplane shall be launched by hand without an additional pilot. 
    }
    {
        This enables the launch by a single person, e.g. by throwing
        with automated acceleration and stabilization.
    }

\dd
    {2}{Climbing}
    {
        The airplane shall climb to a predefined altitude after launch and
        circle the launch site at this altitude. 
    }
    {
        Climbing and loitering guarantee a controlled environment
        for pre-mission checks.
    }

\dd
    {3}{Mission}
    {
        The airplane shall be able to follow a predefined set of waypoints, consisting
        of latitude, longitude and altitude. 
    }
    {
        This enables the implementation of a wide range of use cases.
    }

\dd
    {4}{Landing}
    {
        The airplane shall be able to follow land at a predefined landing position.    
    }
    {
        A safe landing guarantees the fast reuse of the craft and the collection
        of all mission data.
    }
\dd
    {5}{Range}
    {
        The airplane minimum range of the aircraft shall be 100km
    }
    {
        This range allows for the execution of a wide range of missions.
    }
\dd
    {6}{Error Handling}
    {
        The airplane shall provide all information required for finding
        errors, both on the ground and when loitering.
    }
    {
        This allows for the fast detection of errors.
    }
